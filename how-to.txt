To have the correct time in the container you need to adjust the "TZ" value in the Dockerfile.

You have to place the model data in the model folder, like it's shown in the screenshot "model.png".

Then you need to build the image, with something like:
docker build --tag sort .

After that you can just start it with:
docker run -p 5000:5000 sort

If you want to mount folders (to see and make change without having to start the container again) you can start it like this (the first part of the -v command is your local folder, the second is the folder in the container):
docker run -v C:\Git\freelance\02_docker_image\script.py:/src/script.py -v C:\Git\freelance\02_docker_image\results:/src/results -v C:\Git\freelance\02_docker_image\templates:/src/templates -v C:\Git\freelance\02_docker_image\upload:/src/upload -p 5000:5000 test

You can also start it interactively, with the "-it" tag and the "/bin/bash" at the end, like this (in that case you'd want to comment out the last line in the Dockerfile, and run "python script.py" manually):
docker run -it -v C:\Git\freelance\02_docker_image\script.py:/src/script.py -v C:\Git\freelance\02_docker_image\results:/src/results -v C:\Git\freelance\02_docker_image\templates:/src/templates -v C:\Git\freelance\02_docker_image\upload:/src/upload -p 5000:5000 test /bin/bash
